To run this project you must download the most recent version of Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and install.

Once installed, you must use a terminal (powershell, cmd, or an integrated terminal in an IDE) to run node before the project will execute/

Node acts similar to XAMPP in creating a virtual server to test and run the website.

In the root directory of the project, you will need to execute the command node expServer.js 

This command will begin running the expServer.js file, which provides all of the communication with the database and delivery of dynamic content to the user.

After executing this command you will direct your web browser to http://localhost:3000/ and begin browsing from there.
